# Top-Projects

**Top-Projects** is the official showcase of several of my most advanced AI / ML / simulation projects — from classic algorithms to cutting-edge simulated-biology and speculative-AI experiments.  

---

##  Repository Overview

This repo groups together multiple “top” projects, each demonstrating a different facet of my skills in machine learning, neural networks, simulation, and AI research.  
Projects currently included:

| Project | Description (short) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Adaptive Universal Simulation Agent | A project exploring general-purpose simulation agents (details in its folder) |
| Ant Colony Optimization for Path Generation | Implementation of ant-colony algorithm for path/graph problems |
| Health Risk Assessment | ML-based health-risk prediction / analysis project |
| Mosses Seed Growth over Time | Simulation of moss-seed growth over time under varying conditions |
| Subterra_Project Underground Alien Possibility | Exploratory simulation assessing possibility of alien survival underground on Earth |

> Each subfolder contains full code (mostly in Jupyter notebooks + Python), documentation, and a README for the specific project.

- **Document exploratory research** across different conceptual and scientific domains.


##  Technologies Used (Across Projects)

Most projects include:

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Custom Simulation Logic**

Project folders include their own specific requirements where necessary.

## Use Cases

You can use this repository to:
- Learn how different AI and simulation methods work
- Build your own projects on top of these
- Study classical algorithms like ACO
- Explore hypothetical biological/sci-fi inspired simulations
- Understand my approach in AI Cadmey-style research projects


## Roadmap

Planned future improvements:
- Add reinforcement learning examples
