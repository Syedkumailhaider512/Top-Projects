# Top-Projects 🚀

**Top-Projects** is the official showcase of several of my most advanced AI / ML / simulation projects — from classic algorithms to cutting-edge simulated-biology and speculative-AI experiments.

## 📂 Repository Overview

This repo groups together multiple “top” projects, each demonstrating a different facet of my skills in machine learning, neural networks, simulation, and AI research.  
Projects currently included:

| Project | Description (short) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Adaptive Universal Simulation Agent | A project exploring general-purpose simulation agents (details in its folder) |
| Ant Colony Optimization for Path Generation | Implementation of ant-colony algorithm for path/graph problems |
| Health Risk Assessment | ML-based health-risk prediction / analysis project |
| Mosses Seed Growth over Time | Simulation of moss-seed growth over time under varying conditions |
| Subterra_Project Underground Alien Possibility | Exploratory simulation assessing possibility of alien survival underground on Earth |

> Each subfolder contains full code (mostly in Jupyter notebooks + Python), documentation, and a README for the specific project.

## 🧠 Why This Collection

- To **demonstrate range** — from classical algorithms (e.g. Ant Colony Optimization) to biologically inspired simulations and speculative AI research.  
- To **serve as a portfolio** — especially useful when applying for research, collaborations, jobs, or open-source contributions.  
- To **enable reuse and extension** — each project can serve as a basis for further experimentation, adaptation, or production-ready development.
